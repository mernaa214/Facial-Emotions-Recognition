# ðŸ§  Facial Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning

Developed a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying human emotions from facial expressions. The project involved preprocessing image datasets, extracting facial features, and training a CNN-based model to recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. Implemented data augmentation to improve model accuracy and robustness. The system aims to enhance humanâ€“computer interaction and can be applied in areas like mental health monitoring, customer experience analysis, and security systems.
